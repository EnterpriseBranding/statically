## Cache Behavior

There are two versions of Staticaly: **Production and Development**. Below you will learn how to use Staticaly as a Production CDN and Development CDN.

*   **Production CDN**

    By default, Staticaly Raw Files CDN cache are set to **1 year** via `Cache-Control` header for every files except on the **master** branch, we set cache for **master** branch **for 24 hours** so new changes you push to GitHub will be reflected within this time.

    But if you want to use Staticaly as a **Development CDN** you can add query string `?env=dev` to tell CDN to not cache your files, you can learn more at Development CDN section below.

    The CDN caches files based on their permanent URL.

    Example:

    * GitHub [https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js)
    * Imgpx [https://cdn.staticaly.com/img/i.imgur.com/9usQKZg.jpg](https://cdn.staticaly.com/img/i.imgur.com/9usQKZg.jpg)

*   **Development CDN** `?env=dev`

    You can use Staticaly as a Development CDN, it means Staticaly CDN will not cache files, new changes you push to GitHub will be reflected within minutes. Development CDN will works when you set up `?env=dev` query string on the URL.

    Example:

    * [https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js?env=dev](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/jquery/jquery-dist/master/dist/jquery.min.js?env=dev)
